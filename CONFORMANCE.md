# Conformance validation

The specification is authoritative. Passing the reference harness does not
establish conformance for behavior it does not exercise. Known reference
divergences below must be resolved with discriminating vectors before a
stable edition can be published under [PUBLICATION.md](PUBLICATION.md).

## URL resolution

WIST-2 §11 step 5 specifies RFC 3986 §5. The `normalize_url` function in
`tools/link_extraction.py` delegates relative resolution to `urljoin`, which
does not implement that procedure for these inputs:

| Candidate | Base | Required result | Reference result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `https:///x` | `https://example.com/blog/post-1` | Reject the empty host | `https://example.com/x` |
| `a//b` | `https://example.com/blog/post-1` | `https://example.com/blog/a//b` | `https://example.com/blog/a/b` |
| `x//` | `https://example.com/blog/post-1` | `https://example.com/blog/x//` | `https://example.com/blog/x/` |

An explicitly empty authority cannot inherit the base host. Empty path
segments survive merging and removal of dot segments. The link-extraction
vectors do not exercise these cases. Correct the reference resolver and
add positive and negative cases without changing the specified algorithm.

## Recovery history resolution

### Declaration field and key eligibility

WIST-1 §5.2 requires failed Declaration acceptance to reject its whole Block
with the failing check's error code. The suite does not assign a diagnostic
to otherwise canonicalizable Declaration schema failures during replacement
or replay. WIST1-E05 covers invalid JCS input, WIST1-E08 the enumerated
sequence and key-set violations, and WIST2-E04 malformed first-contact
Declaration pulls. Specify the remaining syntax-failure classification,
including malformed `observed_at` and `valid_from`, with signed field
mutations and atomic Block-rejection vectors before claiming complete field
validation. Treating an unparseable key-time comparison as WIST1-E02 is not
an established schema-error rule.

WIST-1 §4 excludes noncanonically encoded and small-order public keys from
the Key Set. It does not explicitly determine the disposition of an otherwise
authenticated Declaration containing an unused excluded key, or where exclusion
occurs relative to §5.2's signer-candidate E01/E02 distinction. Specify whether
the Declaration rejects as a whole or retains its signed entries while deriving
usable bindings. Exercise initial, ordinary and recovery authentication,
unused excluded keys and excluded named signers with signed vectors.

The `publisher.schema.json` `hostname` and `date-time` formats require checks
beyond typed JSON deserialization. Optional fields present as `null`, empty
signing arrays, string bounds and §4's safe-integer bound also need validation.
Declaration idempotence exempts re-verifying a signature, not the requirement
for a structurally valid Envelope. The reference's Declaration schema checks
in `tools/validate_examples.py` do not enable format assertions; their passing
results establish neither hostname nor date-time format conformance.

### Authenticated recovery state

WIST-1 §5.2 and WIST-4 §9 freeze each recovery window’s length at its
owner Block’s in-force parameter map. `recovery_window_cases` in
`vectors/wist4/parameter-combinations.json` exercises exact effective-time
and settlement boundaries, later shortening/lengthening, in-window followers,
new windows and exact arithmetic beyond signed 64-bit seconds. Accepted
amendments and eligible recovery events are supplied inputs; integrated
replay must derive them from authenticated history before applying the rule.

WIST-1 §5.2 and WIST-3 §3.3 select recovery ownership in ascending
`(Block height, seq)` order. `vectors/wist1/recovery-order.json` exercises
signed Declarations and predecessor links in authenticated Block chains,
including reversed leaf-hash order. WIST-1 §5.2 separately retains the highest
accepted sequence through settlement and defines eligible predecessor heads.
`vectors/wist1/recovery-heads.json` authenticates a complete hourly Block chain
and probes ordinary/recovery followers across competitors, stale predecessor
rejection, named-predecessor classification, the deadline transition and
idempotent re-serving of the restored lower-sequence head. Its reference
validates Declaration authorship separately from Block inclusion. It asserts
no identity-reset or conflicting-batch result.

WIST-1 §5.2 and WIST-3 §3.3 reject conflicting equal-sequence Declaration
groups as an entire Block under `WIST1-E08`, preserving the accepted prefix
and state. Only already-current publisher re-serves or identical first-install
Envelopes are nonconflicting; differing signatures cannot choose a new
Declaration's ordinary/recovery authority by leaf order.
`vectors/wist1/declaration-conflicts.json` exercises signed sibling and
signature conflicts, initial and open-window cases, idempotence, independent
domains and atomic rejection. Service admission and replay must adopt these
rules; a Block signature alone does not establish Declaration admissibility.

WIST-4 §6.3 preserves the recovery owner's identity from its application
onward. In-window fresh competitors cause no reset or sanction lift in any
prefix; settlement does not restore opening values or reverse ordinary
process effects. A fresh predecessor earlier in the owner's Block resets
normally, as does a valid fresh replacement after settlement unless a new
window has opened. `vectors/wist4/recovery-identity.json` authenticates two
hourly Declaration histories with reversed owner/competitor storage order
and deadline probes. Its separate abstract projections exercise identity
scope for age, credit, penalties, findings, rungs and notice targets with
already-eligible inputs. They do not authenticate or establish eligibility
of Audit Records, notices, lifts or appeals, or Snapshot resume conformance.

`vectors/wist1/recovery-settlement.json` authenticates seven 170-Block hourly
histories through the settlement boundary, with admissible fresh competitors,
ordinary descendants and legitimate ordinary/recovery followers. Signed
rejection twins enforce recovery-key protection, predecessor eligibility and
Declaration authorship. A shared key naming a competitor cannot advance the
recovery chain. Signed Delta inputs exercise admission under the frozen union
and signature-eligible settlement survivors; separate binding probes cover
identifier reuse, aliases, `valid_from`, bad signatures and later re-serving
of a rejected ID. These replace inadmissible abstract recovery-set rotations.
The histories do not establish durable queuing, Payload availability, quotas,
actual survivor inclusion, status reporting or complete historical Delta
verification. Its timestamp comparisons exercise whole-second literal-Z
fixtures only; full RFC 3339 `observed_at` and `valid_from` validation, including
fractional-second ordering, remains required. Those remain integrated
validation obligations.

WIST-3 §7's Snapshot `declaration` tuple carries only the current Envelope
and sealing height, and `recovery_window` carries only owner height and end.
These do not supply the retained accepted sequence floor after restoration
of a lower-sequence head, or both open-window heads. Define sufficient
Snapshot state or required authenticated history reconstruction, with
Snapshot-versus-full-history vectors, before Snapshot recovery replay can
establish conformance. The full-history head vectors do not resolve this
Snapshot representation question.

WIST-4 §7 freezes each sanction notice's appeal Key Set after due settlement
and its Block's complete Declaration stage. An open window selects the
recovery-chain head; otherwise the current Declaration supplies the keys.
Later history cannot rewrite the notice's authority. Signing identifiers
retain their frozen public-key bindings; recovery entries and the Delta
admission union supply no authority. Appeals have no `valid_from` time filter.
`vectors/wist4/recovery-appeals.json` authenticates two 172-Block hourly
Declaration/notice histories, including reversed Declaration sequence/leaf order
and notice leaf hashes that cannot override canonical type grouping,
fresh competitors, a follower with future-dated signing aliases, deadline
rotation, a new recovery window and later identity reset. Independent signed
appeal probes distinguish missing authority from bad signatures and preserve
notice bindings across prefixes and repeated notice inclusion. Signed Block
twins detect invalid author signatures: an invalid Declaration rejects its
Block, while an invalid notice supplies no authority. A signed ordering twin
rejects a Registry Update stored before the Declaration group.

The appeal vectors condition key selection on separately supplied eligible
notice IDs. Their notice evidence and activation identifiers are abstract
inputs, not authenticated findings; Block inclusion and notice authorship
alone do not establish §7 notice eligibility. The unsealed appeal probes
establish signature authority only. Integrated validation must derive notice
eligibility, reject invalid appeals before slot allocation, preserve frozen
bindings on restart, and exercise live publication, sealing, deadlines,
rulings and retention. No Snapshot resume behavior is established.

## Validation still required

The vector-family inventory in `tools/VERIFICATION.md` distinguishes
independent anchors from self-consistency. The following acceptance evidence
must also be supplied before stable publication; isolated signature or
arithmetic checks do not establish live-service behavior.

| Surface | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| WIST-1 §4 canonicalization | Correctly rounded binary64 edge cases, fractional JSON values in signed objects and rejection outside the finite range |
| WIST-1 §5.2 Declaration key binding | Initial admission, replacement and historical replay consume `declaration-binding.json`; duplicate identifiers reject and reused identifiers or aliases preserve the authenticated public key's correct identity/recovery class |
| WIST-1 §5.2 recovery ownership and heads | Replay consumes `recovery-order.json`, `recovery-heads.json` and `declaration-conflicts.json`, authenticating each Declaration against its eligible named predecessor, retaining the accepted sequence floor and settling before deadline-Block Declarations. Reject conflicting groups and failed Declaration acceptance atomically; canonical storage order cannot choose a winner or replace a recovery owner. Snapshot state requires the resolution listed above. |
| WIST-1 §5.2 recovery settlement | Consume `recovery-settlement.json`, authenticating Declaration acceptance separately from Block inclusion and verifying full Delta key bindings. Preserve the fixed admission union, named recovery chain, original queue order and WIST1-E13 status effects. Demonstrate durable queue recovery, applicable quotas, Payload availability and actual survivor sealing; signature eligibility alone does not establish these duties. |
| WIST-4 §6.3 recovery identity | Consume `recovery-identity.json`; integrate its reset boundaries with authenticated Delta/Audit Record history, candidate-Block parameter profiles, notice evidence and due process. Recovery preserves identity without freezing state or retroactively altering earlier prefixes. Abstract projection inputs do not establish these integrated obligations. |
| WIST-4 §7 appeal authority | Consume `recovery-appeals.json` with independently established notice eligibility. Preserve notice-era signing bindings across recovery, rotations, resets, repeated notice inclusion and restart; apply signature eligibility before appeal-slot allocation and process replay. Exercise live appeal publication/sealing, deadlines and resulting retention with authenticated finding histories. |
| WIST-2 §§3–5, 7 Feed pulls | Domain mismatch and unusable-Feed classification; Declaration refresh before counting signature failure; seen-ID bookkeeping; Page creation/sealing timestamps |
| WIST-2 §7 and WIST-4 §6.4 quotas | Error-code accounting, `WIST2-E05` exclusion, UTC-day parameter/reputation anchor and live quota application |
| WIST-2 §§6, 8 scheduling and redirects | Hints change audit timing without creating a selection duty; redirect termination and authority restrictions under live pulls |
| WIST-3 §§5–6 publication | Durable Block publication before its Checkpoint; Payload replication before the Block; acquisition of cited evidence before serving a notice |
| WIST-3 §§3.1, 6 transport parsing | Independent decoding of the Block-frame vectors and general compressed/checksummed frames; rejection of extra frames, skippable data and trailing bytes; leap-second rejection in all Log-comparable timestamp fields and Snapshot tuples; the full four-digit Gregorian year range, including late December 9999 independently of library timestamp limits. The raw-frame reference in `tools/block_frames.py` does not implement entropy decoding or checksum verification. |
| WIST-3 §§3.4, 5 Log key succession | A rotated Aggregator key authenticates Blocks and Checkpoints at the correct height, including rejected keys |
| WIST-4 §§4–5 audit execution | Small-order VRF key rejection; actual fetch byte, time and redirect limits; reference/observed failures; WARC capture and required evidence retention |
| WIST-4 §6.4 inclusion | Acceptance and per-domain turn accounting under backlog, overload and recovery; the Log alone does not reveal acceptance time |
| WIST-4 §§3.1, 5.1–5.2, 7 integration | Observer and canary publication, authenticated admission evidence, accepted notice service and complete appeal processes across the four roles |

These are validation requirements, not assertions that every boundary lacks
unit coverage. Current vectors already exercise, among other cases,
normalization, key-set selection, late appeals and notice activation targets.
Provide an exact specification commit and the exercised obligations when
claiming that any row is satisfied.

## Object-version policy

WIST-1 §3.1 prohibits new fields in a minor object version. Draft changes
include required Audit Record fields and additional Registry Update actions
while objects still carry `wist_version = 1.0.0`. Before final consolidation
or an adopted wire-format change, determine explicitly whether successive
drafts define one unreleased object version or require a new major object
version. Align document labels and signed objects with that decision and
add discriminating vectors. The draft publication policy itself changes
neither object acceptance nor version semantics.
